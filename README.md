# Weibo Style
A clean, mordern style for [Sina Weibo](http://weibo.com/).

[Preview](http://d.pr/i/byoD)

## Introduction
Heavy Sina Weibo users like me feel fucked up by Sina every day with those annoying badges, shitty banners and terrible layouts. With help of Chrome extensions like AdBlock Plus and '眼不见心不烦', we sufferd less because unrelevant badges and icons and ads are blocked by them. But that's not enough, we can do more than that, so I'd like to change the layout to fill our eyes with an even cleanner and mordern layout. With this stylesheet, a lot of elements in the page are altered so that we can say goodbye to a bad experience while surfing on Weibo.

If you want any help about this little trick, you can just tweet at [@hoola](http://weibo.com/hola). :)

## Requirements
* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)

* [眼不见心不烦](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aognaapdfnnldnjglanfbbklaakbpejm) for Google Chrome

* [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) for Google Chrome

## Installation
First of all, you need to install two extensions for Google Chrome as mentioned in the Requirement section.

Then open the preference panel for Stylish. Copy the [stylesheet content](https://github.com/marvyn/Weibo-Style/blob/master/style.css) into the Code area. In the 'Applies to' fieldset, choose 'URLs on the domain' and input 'weibo.com', choose a Style name and enable it. ([Settings for Stylish screen capture](http://d.pr/i/DKTU))

At last, make sure you enable the '双栏板式' option in the preference panel for '眼不见心不烦'. ([Settings for '眼不见心不烦' screen capture](http://d.pr/i/mVLn))
