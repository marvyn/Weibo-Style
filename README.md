Weibo Style
===
A clean, mordern style for [Sina Weibo](http://weibo.com/).

Introduction
---
Heavy Sina Weibo users like me feel fucked up by Sina every day with those annoying badges, shitty banners and terrible layouts. With help of Chrome extension like AdBlock Plus and userscript like '眼不见心不烦', we sufferd less because unrelevant badges and ads are filtered by them. But that's not enough, I'd like to change the layout to fill our eyes with an even cleanner and mordern layout. With this stylesheet, I alterd a lot of elements in the page so we get pleased when surfing on Weibo.
