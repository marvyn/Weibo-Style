## Introduction
Heavy Sina Weibo users like me feel fucked up by Sina every day with those annoying badges, shitty banners and terrible layouts. With help of Chrome extensions like AdBlock Plus and '眼不见心不烦', we sufferd less because unrelevant badges and icons and ads are blocked by them. But that's not enough, we can do more than that, so I'd like to change the whole page to fill our eyes with an even cleanner and mordern layout. With this stylesheet, a lot of elements in the page are altered so that we can say goodbye to a bad experience while surfing on Weibo.

If you want any help about this little trick, please just tweet at [@hoola](http://weibo.com/hola). :)

## Requirements
* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)

* [眼不见心不烦](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aognaapdfnnldnjglanfbbklaakbpejm) extension for Google Chrome


## Installation
First of all, you need to install the '眼不见心不烦' extension for Google Chrome as mentioned above in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

Then open the preference panel for '眼不见心不烦'. In the left menu, select the '改变版式' section. Check the '双栏版式' option. Copy the [stylesheet content](https://github.com/marvyn/Weibo-Style/blob/master/style.min.css) into the '自定义样式' code area. Then hit the '确定' button to save all the settings.

Congrats, there you go!
